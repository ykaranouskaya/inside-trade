# Feel being Sherlock Holmes

*This is a very experimental project.*

## Intro

The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission EDGAR database contains a lot of different fillings by corporations, funds,
and individuals. There is one type of forms of a particular interest: Form 4A. This forms contains "insider" information,
mainly, any officer or beneficial owner buying/selling its company's stock has to fill this form. It naturally feels that 
this insider information must be somehow correlated to the stock's performance. This project is an attempt to investigate
the relations between forms 4A information and future stock prices.


## Data

I use the following data sources:

* EDGAR database [https://www.sec.gov/edgar/searchedgar/accessing-edgar-data.htm]

* AlphVantage Market Data [https://www.alphavantage.co/]

## TO DO

* ~Design a scraper for EDGAR data~
* ~Create an API for market data fetching~ 
* -> Exploratory Analysis
* Provide continuous data collecting
* Design a simplest model and benchmark it
* Other Things that are too far from where I am now
